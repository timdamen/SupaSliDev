# Installation

This guide walks you through setting up a new Supaslidev workspace on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Supaslidev, ensure you have the following tools installed:

### Node.js

Supaslidev requires **Node.js 18.0.0 or higher**.

Check your Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
```

If you need to install or update Node.js, visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).

### pnpm

Supaslidev uses **pnpm 9.0.0 or higher** for workspace management.

Check if pnpm is installed:

```bash
pnpm --version
```

To install pnpm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Or use [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) (recommended):

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

## Create a Workspace

Run the scaffolding command to create a new Supaslidev workspace:

```bash
pnpm create supaslidev
```

The wizard will prompt you for:

1. **Workspace name**: The directory name for your workspace
2. **First presentation name**: Name of your initial presentation

The scaffolding process will:

- Create the workspace directory structure
- Set up `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with catalog dependencies
- Initialize your first presentation
- Optionally initialize a git repository
- Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies

## Post-Installation

After the workspace is created, navigate into it:

```bash
cd your-workspace-name
```

Install the dashboard globally or use it via pnpm scripts:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This opens the interactive dashboard where you can manage all your presentations.

## Verify Installation

Confirm everything is working by starting the dev server for your first presentation:

```bash
pnpm present your-first-presentation
```

This should:

1. Start a Vite dev server
2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3030`
3. Display your presentation with hot reload enabled

You can also verify the workspace status:

```bash
npx create-supaslidev status
```

This shows your workspace version and checks for available updates.

## Next Steps

Your Supaslidev workspace is ready. Learn how to [create and manage presentations](/getting-started/usage) or explore the [dashboard interface](/guide/dashboard).
