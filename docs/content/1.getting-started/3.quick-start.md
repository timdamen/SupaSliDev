::callout{type="info" icon="i-heroicons-clock"}
**Time required**: ~5 minutes. By the end, you'll have a workspace with a running presentation.
::

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed
- **pnpm 9+** installed

If not, see the [Installation guide](/getting-started/installation#prerequisites) for setup instructions.

## Step 1: Create Your Workspace

Run the scaffolding command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm create supaslidev
```

The wizard prompts you for a few options:

1. **Workspace name**: Enter a name like `my-presentations`
2. **First presentation name**: Enter a name like `hello-world`
3. **Initialize git**: Select yes (recommended)
4. **Install dependencies**: Select yes

<!-- Screenshot: Terminal showing create-supaslidev wizard prompts -->

Wait for the dependencies to install.

## Step 2: Navigate to Your Workspace

Once scaffolding completes, move into your new workspace:

```bash
cd my-presentations
```

## Step 3: Start the Dashboard

Launch the interactive dashboard:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This opens the Supaslidev dashboard in your browser.

From the dashboard you can:

- See all your presentations at a glance
- Start and stop presentation dev servers
- Create new presentations

## Step 4: Present Your First Deck

Click the **Present** button on your `hello-world` presentation card. This starts a Slidev dev server and opens your presentation in a new browser tab.

Alternatively, start it directly from the terminal:

```bash
pnpm present hello-world
```

Your presentation is now running at `http://localhost:3030` with hot reload enabled. Edit `presentations/hello-world/slides.md` and watch your changes appear instantly.
