# Project Structure

This page explains how a Supaslidev workspace is organized and where different files belong.

## Workspace Overview

After creating a workspace with `pnpm create supaslidev`, you'll have the following structure:

```
my-workspace/
├── .supaslidev/           # Workspace state and metadata
│   └── state.json
├── presentations/         # Your Slidev presentations
│   ├── quarterly-review/
│   ├── product-launch/
│   └── team-onboarding/
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml    # Workspace configuration and catalog
├── package.json           # Root package configuration
└── pnpm-lock.yaml         # Dependency lockfile
```

## The presentations/ Folder

Each presentation lives in its own folder under `presentations/`. When you run `pnpm dashboard new my-talk`, it creates:

```
presentations/my-talk/
├── slides.md              # Your slide content
├── package.json           # Presentation dependencies (uses catalog:)
├── .gitignore             # Ignores build artifacts and caches
└── .npmrc                 # pnpm configuration
```

### Presentation package.json

Each presentation has a minimal `package.json` that references the workspace catalog:

```json
{
  "name": "@supaslidev/my-talk",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "slidev build",
    "dev": "slidev --open",
    "export": "slidev export"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@slidev/cli": "catalog:",
    "@slidev/theme-default": "catalog:",
    "vue": "catalog:"
  }
}
```

The `catalog:` specifier tells pnpm to resolve the version from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. This keeps all presentations on the same dependency versions.

## The .supaslidev/ Folder

The `.supaslidev/` directory stores workspace metadata:

```
.supaslidev/
└── state.json             # Workspace state
```

### state.json

Tracks the workspace version and applied migrations:

```json
{
  "cliVersion": "0.1.0",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "appliedMigrations": []
}
```

This file enables the migration system to upgrade your workspace when new Supaslidev versions are released. You should commit this file to version control.

## pnpm-workspace.yaml

The workspace configuration file defines which packages belong to the workspace and centralizes dependency versions:

```yaml
packages:
  - 'presentations/*'

catalog:
  '@slidev/cli': ^52.11.3
  '@slidev/theme-default': latest
  '@slidev/theme-seriph': latest
  'vue': ^3.5.26
```

### Workspace Packages

The `packages` array tells pnpm which directories contain workspace packages. The `presentations/*` glob includes all presentation folders.

### Catalog Dependencies

The `catalog` section defines shared dependency versions. When a presentation's `package.json` uses `"@slidev/cli": "catalog:"`, pnpm resolves it to the version specified here (`^52.11.3`).

Benefits of catalog dependencies:

::list{type="success"}

- **Consistency**: All presentations use identical dependency versions
- **Single update point**: Upgrade Slidev once in the catalog, and all presentations get the update
- **Reduced lockfile churn**: Fewer version conflicts when adding new presentations
  ::

## Root package.json

The root `package.json` provides workspace-level scripts and configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "my-workspace",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dashboard": "supaslidev"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@supaslidev/dashboard": "^0.1.0"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Generated Directories

These directories are generated during development and builds. They should be in your `.gitignore`:

| Directory                  | Purpose                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `node_modules/`            | Installed dependencies           |
| `presentations/*/dist/`    | Built presentation files         |
| `presentations/*/.slidev/` | Slidev cache and temporary files |
