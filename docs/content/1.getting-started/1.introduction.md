# Introduction

Supaslidev is a monorepo toolkit for managing multiple [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) presentations. It provides a streamlined workflow for teams and individuals who create and maintain several slide decks.

## The Problem

Managing multiple Slidev presentations introduces challenges:

- **Dependency chaos**: Each presentation has its own `package.json` with potentially different versions of Slidev and plugins
- **No central management**: Starting dev servers, building, or exporting requires navigating to each presentation directory
- **Inconsistent setup**: New presentations lack standardized configuration
- **Version drift**: Keeping Slidev versions synchronized across presentations becomes tedious

## The Solution

Supaslidev solves these problems with a pnpm workspace architecture and two complementary CLI tools:

1. **create-supaslidev**: Scaffolds new workspaces with centralized dependency management using pnpm catalogs
2. **@supaslidev/dashboard**: Provides an interactive dashboard and CLI for managing all presentations from one place

## Key Features

- **Workspace scaffolding**: Create new Supaslidev workspaces with a single command
- **Interactive dashboard**: Visual interface to browse, start, and manage all presentations
- **Centralized dependencies**: pnpm catalog keeps Slidev versions consistent across presentations
- **PDF export**: Export any presentation to PDF with one command
- **Deployment builds**: Generate production-ready SPA builds for hosting
- **Migration system**: Upgrade workspaces when new versions are released

## How It Works

A Supaslidev workspace organizes presentations as packages within a pnpm monorepo:

```
my-presentations/
├── presentations/
│   ├── quarterly-review/
│   ├── product-launch/
│   └── team-onboarding/
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml    # Defines workspace packages and catalog versions
└── package.json
```

Each presentation uses `catalog:` references in its `package.json`, ensuring all presentations share the same dependency versions defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
