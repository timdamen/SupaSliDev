# Dashboard

The Supaslidev dashboard is a visual interface for managing all your presentations from one place.

![Dashboard UI](/images/dashboard-ui.png){.rounded-lg .shadow-lg}

## Launching the Dashboard

Start the dashboard from your workspace root:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command:

1. Scans the `presentations/` directory and generates presentation metadata
2. Starts an API server to manage presentation dev servers
3. Launches the dashboard UI in your browser

## View Modes

The dashboard supports two view modes for displaying your presentations.

### Grid View

The default view displays presentations as cards in a responsive grid layout. Each card shows the presentation title, description, theme, and status at a glance.

<!-- Screenshot: Dashboard grid view with multiple presentation cards -->

Grid view works well when you have many presentations and want to see visual overviews.

### List View

List view displays presentations as compact rows with key information inline. This mode is useful when you prefer a denser layout or have many presentations to scan through.

<!-- Screenshot: Dashboard list view showing presentations as rows -->

Toggle between views using the command palette or by typing `Toggle view` in the header input.

::callout{type="tip" icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
Your view preference is saved to localStorage and persists across sessions.

## Search

Filter presentations by typing in the search input below the header. The list updates as you type, showing only presentations whose titles match your query.

The search is case-insensitive and matches anywhere in the title.

```
Search presentations by title...
```

When no presentations match your search, the dashboard displays an empty state with a button to clear the filter.

## Status Indicators

Each presentation card shows its current server status.

### Idle

When a presentation server is not running, the card displays a neutral **idle** badge. The dev button shows `dev` and clicking it starts the server.

### Live

When a dev server is running, the card displays:

- A green **live** badge with a pulsing indicator
- The localhost URL and port (e.g., `localhost:3030`)
- A "click to open" hint
- The card border glows green

The dev button changes to `stop`. Clicking the card itself opens the presentation in a new browser tab.

## Presentation Cards

Each presentation appears as a card displaying:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Path** | The presentation folder path (e.g., `~/my-presentation`) |
| **Title** | The presentation name from its frontmatter |
| **Description** | Optional description from the presentation's metadata |
| **Theme badge** | Shows the Slidev theme (e.g., `--theme=default`) |
| **Duration badge** | Displays estimated duration if configured (e.g., `--duration=30min`) |
| **Dev button** | Starts or stops the presentation's dev server |
| **Export button** | Exports the presentation to PDF |

## Interacting with Presentations

### Starting a Dev Server

Click the **dev** button on a card. The dashboard:

1. Starts a Slidev dev server for that presentation
2. Opens the presentation in a new browser tab after a short delay
3. Updates the card to show the **live** status

### Stopping a Server

When a presentation is running, click the **stop** button to shut down that presentation's dev server.

### Opening a Running Presentation

Click anywhere on a card with a running server to open the presentation in a new tab.

### Exporting to PDF

Click the **export** button to generate a PDF of the presentation. When complete, the PDF opens in a new browser tab.

## Command Palette

Press `⌘K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette. This provides quick access to all dashboard actions:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **New** | Create a new presentation |
| **Import** | Import existing Slidev presentations |
| **Toggle theme** | Switch between light and dark mode |
| **Toggle view** | Switch between grid and list layout |
| **Present > [name]** | Start a specific presentation |
| **Export > [name]** | Export a specific presentation to PDF |

You can also type commands directly in the header input with autocomplete support.

## Theme Toggle

The dashboard supports light and dark modes. Toggle the theme using:

- The sun/moon icon button in the header
- The command palette (`Toggle theme`)
- Typing `Toggle theme` in the header input

Your theme preference syncs with your system settings by default.

## Creating Presentations

Click the **new** button or use the `New` command to open the create presentation dialog. Enter a name for your presentation (lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens) and the dashboard creates it using the Slidev template with catalog dependencies.
