# Export & Deploy

Share your presentations by exporting them to PDF or deploying them as static websites.

## PDF Export

Export any presentation to a PDF file using the CLI:

```bash
pnpm supaslidev export my-presentation
```

The PDF is saved to `dist/my-presentation.pdf` by default.

### Custom Output Path

Specify a custom output path with the `--output` flag:

```bash
pnpm supaslidev export my-presentation --output ./exports/quarterly-review.pdf
```

The output directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

### Export from Dashboard

You can also export presentations through the dashboard UI:

1. Click the **export** button on any presentation card
2. The PDF opens in a new browser tab when complete

## Deployment

Build a presentation for deployment to static hosting platforms:

```bash
pnpm supaslidev deploy my-presentation
```

This command:

1. Builds the presentation using `slidev build`
2. Copies the build output to a deployment package
3. Generates configuration files for Vercel and Netlify

### Output Location

The deployment package is created at `deploy/my-presentation/` by default. Specify a custom location with the `--output` flag:

```bash
pnpm supaslidev deploy my-presentation --output ./release/my-presentation
```

### Deployment Package Contents

| File           | Description                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `dist/`        | Static build output (HTML, CSS, JS) |
| `vercel.json`  | Vercel deployment configuration     |
| `netlify.toml` | Netlify deployment configuration    |
| `package.json` | Package metadata for deployment     |

### Deploy to Vercel

Deploy the package using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
cd deploy/my-presentation && vercel
```

Or push the deployment folder to Git and import the repository in the Vercel dashboard.

### Deploy to Netlify

Deploy using the Netlify CLI:

```bash
cd deploy/my-presentation && netlify deploy --prod
```

Alternatively, connect your Git repository in the Netlify dashboard and configure the publish directory as `dist`.

## Advanced Export Options

Supaslidev uses Slidev's export and build commands under the hood. For advanced configuration options like custom formats, page ranges, or build settings, see the [Slidev Export Documentation](https://sli.dev/guide/exporting).
