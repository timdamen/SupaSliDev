# Dashboard Overview

The Supaslidev dashboard provides a visual interface and CLI commands for managing all your presentations from one place. It handles starting dev servers, creating new presentations, exporting to PDF, and preparing deployment packages.

## Launching the Dashboard

Start the dashboard from your workspace root:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command:

1. Scans the `presentations/` directory and generates presentation metadata
2. Starts an API server to manage presentation dev servers
3. Launches the dashboard UI in your browser

The dashboard automatically detects all presentations in your workspace and displays them in a grid layout.

## Dashboard Interface

The dashboard UI provides a visual way to manage your presentations.

### Header

The header displays the Supaslidev title and a **New Presentation** button. Click this button to create a new presentation directly from the interface.

### Search and Filter

A search input lets you filter presentations by title. As you type, the grid updates to show only matching presentations.

### Presentation Cards

Each presentation appears as a card displaying:

- **Thumbnail**: A preview image if the presentation has a background configured
- **Title**: The presentation name from its frontmatter
- **Description**: Optional description from the presentation's metadata
- **Theme badge**: Shows which Slidev theme the presentation uses
- **Duration badge**: Displays the estimated presentation duration if configured
- **Status indicator**: A green dot appears when the dev server is running
- **Present/Stop button**: Starts or stops the presentation's dev server

### Interacting with Presentations

**Starting a presentation**: Click the **Present** button on a card. The dashboard starts a Slidev dev server and opens the presentation in a new browser tab.

**Stopping a server**: When a presentation is running, the button changes to **Stop**. Click it to shut down that presentation's dev server.

**Opening a running presentation**: Click anywhere on a card with a running server to open the presentation in a new tab.

## CLI Commands

The dashboard package also provides CLI commands for scriptable workflows.

### pnpm dev

Starts the interactive dashboard UI.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This is the default command. Running `pnpm dev` without arguments launches the full dashboard interface.

### pnpm present \<name\>

Starts a Slidev dev server for a specific presentation without the dashboard UI.

```bash
pnpm present my-talk
```

Use this when you want to work on a single presentation and don't need the full dashboard interface.

### pnpm new \[name\]

Creates a new presentation in the workspace.

```bash
pnpm new quarterly-review
```

This command:

1. Validates the name (lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens only)
2. Checks that a presentation with that name doesn't already exist
3. Runs `pnpm create slidev` in the presentations directory
4. Sets up the new presentation with catalog dependencies

If you omit the name, the command launches Slidev's interactive setup wizard.

```bash
pnpm new
```

### pnpm export \<name\>

Exports a presentation to PDF.

```bash
pnpm export my-talk
```

By default, the PDF is saved to `dist/<name>.pdf` in your workspace root.

Specify a custom output path with the `--output` flag:

```bash
pnpm export my-talk --output ./exports/presentation.pdf
```

### pnpm deploy \<name\>

Builds and prepares a presentation for deployment.

```bash
pnpm deploy my-talk
```

This command:

1. Runs `slidev build` to generate the static SPA
2. Creates a deployment package in `deploy/<name>/`
3. Adds configuration files for Vercel and Netlify

The output directory contains everything needed to deploy to a static hosting platform:

```
deploy/my-talk/
├── dist/           # Built presentation files
├── vercel.json     # Vercel configuration
├── netlify.toml    # Netlify configuration
└── package.json    # Minimal package for deployment
```

Specify a custom output directory:

```bash
pnpm deploy my-talk --output ./my-deploy-folder
```

After running the command, deploy with your preferred platform:

```bash
# Vercel
cd deploy/my-talk && vercel

# Netlify
cd deploy/my-talk && netlify deploy --prod
```
